# Mixed Message Project
*A Project by Jeff Vergne*

This project is part of the **Fullstack Engineer Career** path from CodeCademy

## Objective
In this project, I’ll be building my own basic design system for a website. In essence, I’ll be building a website to help me build MORE websites in the future! On my site, I’ll collect all the colors, fonts, and some of the repeating styles.

## Technology
Written in HTML5 CSS3

## a few notes
The site is divided into 3 sections: colors, fonts and styles.
- Hover a color to reveal its name and its rgb and hsl values.
- Hovering a font or a style will simply make a border appear for that style.
